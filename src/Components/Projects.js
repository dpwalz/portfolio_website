                    People suffering from permanent or temporary mobility issues can be limited when trying to participate with todayâ€™s 
                    conventional entertainment measures. EOG Mouse Control can play a role in broadening access for those requiring alternative
                    means outside of typical muscle control.

                        How it Works: 
                    </Card.Subtitle>
                    <Card.Text>
                    Two BioAmp EXG Pill sources are used (beside each eye and above and below one eye). 
                    The sources are fed in through an Arduino microcontroller. A series of python code is used to run the application. 
                    The application allows a user to complete full range of mouse movements and left and right mouse click action with use of
                    EOG muscles.
